                                Battles are not calculated in advance, they take place on the map in real time. Any player can join and leave the battle at any time, giving the game a real-time strategy feel. Are your ally being attacked in your region? Send troops to help or launch a surprise counterattack on the city.

                                All the events of the game take place on one huge map inhabited by players and NPCs. No isolated bases or separate battle screens. Never before used on mobile devices, the infinite zoom feature allows you to freely switch between a general view of the world and snapshots of individual cities or barbarian outposts. The map features both natural obstacles such as rivers and mountain ranges, as well as strategic passages that must be conquered in order to gain access to neighboring regions.
